      The code defines a function named counter which returns another function
      named IncreaseCounter. The IncreaseCounter function increments a variable
      counter each time it is called.

    <h2>Q-2</h2>
    <pre>
        let count = 0;
(function () {
  if (count === 0) {
    let count = 1;
    console.log(count); // What is logged?
  }
  console.log(count); // What is logged?
})();

    <pre>

        0
    </pre>
    <p>
      the variable count is declared and initialized with a value of 0 outside
      of the immediately invoked function expression. Inside the function, a new
      variable named count is declared using the let keyword and initialized
      with a value of 1. This new variable count is block scoped and does not
      affect the outer count variable. When console.log(count) is called inside
      the if block, it will log the value of the inner count variable, which is
      1. Outside the if block, when console.log(count) is called again, it will
      log the value of the outer count variable, which is still 0. The inner
      count variable does not affect the outer variable due to the concept of
      variable scope.

"for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {

    <p>
      In the code, a for loop is used to iterate from 0 to 2. Inside the loop, a
      setTimeout function is called with a delay of 1000 milliseconds, and it
      logs the value of i to the console. However, since var is used to declare
      the variable i, it has function-level scope, not block-level scope. This
      means that the variable i is shared among all iterations of the loop and
      is not scoped to the individual iterations. After the for loop finishes
      executing, the value of i will be 3. Therefore, when the setTimeout
      callbacks are executed after the delay, they will log the value of i,
      which is 3 for all of them.

    <p>
      The code defines a function named Sum that takes a parameter a. Inside the
      Sum function, there is another function named result that takes a
      parameter b. The result function multiplies a and b and returns the
      result. In your code, you call Sum(10), which returns the result function.
      You assign this function to the variable resultVar. Then, you call
      resultVar(20), passing 20 as the argument to the result function. It
      multiplies 10 (the value of a from the Sum function) with 20 and returns
      the result, which is 200. Finally, the value of res to the console, which
      will be 200.

    <p>
      In this example, the outer function creates an outer scope where the
      counter variable is defined and initialized with 0. The inner function
      increaseCounter has access to the counter variable in the outer scope and
      increments it by 1 every time it is called. The increaseCounter function
      is returned from the outer function. By calling outerfunction(), we create
      an instance of the counter function and assign it to the variable
      counterFunc. Then, we can call counterFunc() multiple times to increase
      the counter and log its updated value to the console.

"Print Output

        var a = 12;

    <p>
      There is a variable a declared and initialized with a value of 12. Then,
      an immediately function expression is used to create a function without a
      name. Inside the function, an alert function is called to display the
      value of a. Inside the function, it references the variable a from the
      outer scope and alerts its value, which is 12. Therefore, when we run this
      code, an alert dialog will appear with the value 12.
    </p>

    <h2>Q-7</h2>
    <pre>
"var a = 10;
        var x = (function () {
          var a = 12;

          };

    <pre>
Output
            12
        </pre
    >
    <p>
      In the code, there are two variables declared a and x. The variable a is
      declared and initialized with a value of 10. The variable x is declared
      and assigned the result of an function. Inside the function, a new
      variable a is declared and initialized with a value of 12. Then, an
      anonymous function is returned from the function. Finally, you call the
      function x(), which invokes the returned function from the parent
      function. This function references the variable a from its local scope,
      which is the inner a variable with a value of 12. It then alerts the value
      of a, which is 12. As a result, when we run this code, an alert dialog
      will appear with the value 12.

    </pre>
    <p>
      The variable globalVar is declared and assigned the value "xyz" in the
      global scope. An immediately function is defined
      with the name outerFunc and an outerArg parameter. Inside this function,
      the variable outerVar is declared and assigned the value 'a'. Within
      outerFunc, another function named innerFunc is defined with the innerArg
      parameter. Inside innerFunc, the variable innerVar is declared and
      assigned the value 'b'. The console.log() statement is executed within
      innerFunc. It logs the following information: The value of outerArg. The
      value of innerArg, which is 456. The value of outerVar, which is 'a'. The
      value of innerVar, which is 'b'. The value of globalVar, which is 'xyz'.
      The outer function with the argument 123, and the inner function with the argument 456
